# Agricultural Application

A web application for farm management, created as part of my bachelor's thesis, based on Angular and Firebase. The application utilizes Material Design principles, is styled using SCSS, and includes TypeScript for robust and maintainable code. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages for accessibility and ease of deployment.
